Hi, I’m interested in a new laptop for work. Any recommendations?
Uh, yeah. What kind of work do you do?
Mostly office tasks, maybe some light photo editing. I don’t want to spend too much, though.
Alright. We have a few mid-range options.
Can you tell me about one?
Sure. There’s [Brand X Model A]. It’s a decent model for general tasks.
Does it come with a warranty?
Yeah, one-year standard. You can add more if you want.
How’s the battery?
Around 7-8 hours on average.
Can I see it in person?
Yep, we have it on display in-store.
Okay. Thanks, I might come by later.
Alright.
